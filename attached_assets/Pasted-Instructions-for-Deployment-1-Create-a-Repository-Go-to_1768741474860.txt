# IRIS-AI: Catchment-Scale Irrigation Intelligence System
### For Water-Use Efficiency and Compliance, Powered by Earth Observation and AI

**Lead Organisation:** University of Johannesburg  
**Project Status:** Active (2025–2027)  
**Focus Area:** Water Utilisation in Agriculture & Digital Transformation

---

## 🌊 Project Overview

**IRIS-AI** (Irrigation Resource Intelligence System - AI) is a pioneering initiative designed to address South Africa’s pressing water governance challenges [1]. By leveraging **Earth Observation (EO)** and **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**, the project aims to optimize irrigation efficiency, enforce compliance, and empower agricultural stakeholders [1].

In semi-arid regions like South Africa, agriculture accounts for 60–70% of national water withdrawals [2]. IRIS-AI bridges the gap between technological innovation and water governance by providing scalable, real-time monitoring tools to bridge the digital divide and ensure sustainable resource management [3].

## 🚀 Key Innovation & Products

The project delivers three core technological solutions:

### 1. IRIS-AI Compliance Dashboard
A tool for regulators (e.g., Department of Water and Sanitation) to monitor water use at a catchment scale.
*   **Technology:** Combines multi-sensor EO data (**Sentinel-2** optical + **Sentinel-1** SAR) with hybrid AI models (**CNN-LSTM**) [4].
*   **Function:** Enables all-weather, real-time irrigation monitoring at 10–30 m resolution [4].
*   **Impact:** Classifies water use into tiers—Red (Unlicensed), Amber (Over-licensed), and Green (Compliant)—to prioritise audits [5]. It aims to reduce unlicensed water abstraction by **30%** in pilot regions [4].

### 2. Farmer Advisory Service (FAS)
A decision support system for commercial and smallholder farmers.
*   **Technology:** Uses fine-tuned **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, such as GPT-4, trained on regional agricultural guidelines [5].
*   **Function:** Delivers hyper-localised irrigation advisories via **SMS, Voice, or Push Notifications** [6].
*   **Accessibility:** Includes a **Mobile-Optimised Dashboard** designed for low-bandwidth (≤2G) rural networks [7].
*   **Impact:** Expected to improve water-use efficiency by **20%** [8].

### 3. Open-Source Code Repository
*   **Goal:** To enable global replication of the ML workflows [4].
*   **Licensing:** Codebases for irrigation mapping and anomaly detection will be released under **MIT** or **CC BY-NC** licenses [5, 9].

## 🛰️ Methodology & Technology

IRIS-AI employs a sophisticated technical framework:

*   **Data Sources:** Sentinel-2 (optical), Sentinel-1 (SAR), Landsat-8/9, and FAO WaPOR data [10].
*   **AI Architecture:** A hybrid **CNN-LSTM** model processes spatial features (CNN) and temporal dynamics (LSTM) to map irrigated areas and detect anomalies [10].
*   **Advisory System:** Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbots synthesise sensor data and weather forecasts into simple, actionable language for farmers (e.g., "Delay irrigation: soil moisture exceeds optimal levels") [5, 11].
*   **Validation:** Models are validated against field campaigns using GPS and soil moisture sensors [5].

---

## 🎯 Impact Goals

*   **Governance:** Scale inspections to cover **100% of high-risk licenses annually** through remote auditing [12].
*   **Economy:** Reduce the cost of manual field audits, which currently range between ZAR 5,000–10,000 per farm [2].
*   **Capacity Building:** Train DWS officials and support MSc students through an EO/AI Training Toolkit [6, 12].
